Open Source load balancers and reverse proxies are stuck in the past century with a very slow pace of development and most of the important features reserved for "Enterprise Editions" which lead developers to use third-party cloud services, exposing their users' traffic to legal, security and reliability risks.

Pingoo is a modern Load Balancer / API Gateway / Reverse Proxy that run on your own servers and already have (or will have soon) all the features you expect from managed services and even more. All of that with a huge boost in performance and security thanks to reduced latency and, of course, Rust ;)

* Automatic and Post-Quantum HTTPS / TLS
* Service Discovery (Docker, DNS...)
* Web Application Firewall (WAF)
* Easy compliance because the data never leaves your servers
* Bot protection and management
* TCP proxying
* GeoIP (country, ASN)
* Static sites
* And much more


## Quickstart

```bash
# You have a static site in the www folder
$ ls www
index.html
$ docker run --rm -ti -p 80:80 -v `pwd`/www:/var/wwww pingooio/pingoo
# Pingoo is now listenning on http://0.0.0.0
```
